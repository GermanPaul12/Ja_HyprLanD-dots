# Asus-G15-2021-hyprland-dots
my hyprland dotfiles for my Asus G15 2021 - Gentoo / Arch

Credits mostly to Arco Linux Hyprland as I got more scripts and styles from them


Its the same dotfiles I am using for my desktop so check out accordingly on the configs

Ensure to make all in scripts as executable atleast in Arch

known issues:
a.) Still cant figure out how to disable touchpad in hyprland :( but it should auto disable if external mouse is connected

b.) as of this writing (March 20, 2022), when disconnecting external monitor from laptop, hyprland will log out. So ensure to save all your work / files
disconnecting your external monitor
