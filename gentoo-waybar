So far this is what I found a work around for clickable workspace. If anything better, please let me know

So waybar from repo does not have hyprland support. Even with 9999 package

so I found an overlay in which, he has hyprland-waybar


# eselect repository add useless-overlay git https://github.com/Wa1t5/useless-overlay

# emaint sync -r useless-overlay


add to your /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords

gui-apps/waybar **


add to your /etc/portage/package.use/waybar

gui-apps/waybar hyprland popups pulseaudio udev experimental mpd network sndio tray wifi -libcxx

(edit as you wish but hyprland and experimental should be there atleast.


then emerge waybar from useless-overlay


# emerge -av gui-apps/waybar

restart your waybar
